I'm currently a Quality Assurance Scientist at Koppert Biological Systems, Inc. I've obtained my BSc in Agronomic Engineering at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. During that time I was doing research at the GEPGeochemistry, a laboratory focused on Soil and Environmental Science, under the supervision of Prof. Tiago Osório Ferreira. 

In 2019, I did an exchange program of 6 months at the University of Western Australia, where I focused mostly on Environmental Assessment and GIS.
